**this work includes the work from Tomasz and Dev**

there are three folders in this repo:

1) FromDev
2) FromTomasz
3) WeiResult

you should believe what is in WeiResult to be what is finally used in lux bk model
it has python script read results from dev and tomasz and the final histogram that I made for bk model.
