This is about everything I have on IsolatedS1/S2s

in the zip you should find the final output files I shared with tomasz
9:16 AM
and two folders - one with the iqs needed to do the analysis
9:16 AM
and the other containing the code
9:17 AM
The main code is in three .mat files Level1_*, Level2.mat, and Level3.mat in the r1 folder
9:18 AM
Level1 is the code to start the parallel processing, and writing to disk operation. It calls on Level2 to do the actual processing
9:18 AM
Level2 is a hacked together event builder based on the .dat files and it hands each temporary built event file to Level3
9:19 AM
Level3 is similar to the data processing framerwork - it calculates the quantities we are interested in and then hands it back to Level1 which writes it to disk
￼
weiji9:20 AM
there are a lot of things in here. which one should I start looking at first
￼
dkhaitan9:21 AM
Start with Level1, then Level2 and finally level3
9:21 AM
all in the r1 folder
9:22 AM
there are many different level1's but they all do the same thing - they just have different file lists for processing
9:23 AM
take a look at the most recent one Level1_sbatch_5.m
￼
weiji9:23 AM
what should I put in as the input and ouput for Level 1(DataSets, RunSettins?)
￼
dkhaitan9:24 AM
that depends on your cluster
9:24 AM
take a look at IsolatedS1S2_r3_1.sbatch for the arguments I needed to pass to the rochester cluster
9:25 AM
Try playing with line 920 and on in Level1 with some dat files you have
9:26 AM
if you want the S1 spect going out higher than a phd you wll have to change the code in 938 and so on
￼
weiji9:26 AM
do you have the intermediate data after your filtering, and before you make the csv files?
￼
dkhaitan9:27 AM
no
9:27 AM
this analysis was when .dat files were still locked because of salting
9:27 AM
so I had to make it completely opaque as to which dat files I used and was not allowed to save anything except for final results
￼
weiji9:30 AM
could you help me understand the csv files first, I think i may need a long time to digest level 1,2,3,
9:30 AM
what is each colomn?
￼
dkhaitan9:34 AM
the file "total_iso_s1_spect_real1.csv" has the isolated S1 spectrum
9:34 AM
and the file "total_s1_spect_real1.csv" has the total s1 spectrum
9:35 AM
in each file the first column is the dataset, the second is the number of events
￼
weiji9:36 AM
I mean in the csv file what are the numbers represent? there are a lot of 1 and 0 there thata I cannot understand
￼
dkhaitan9:37 AM
the third is the livetime, the fourth is th deatime
9:37 AM
aafter that the next 1000 columns are the number of S1 with area between 1 and 101 phe in 0.1 steps
9:37 AM
the 0,1,2,s etc. represent the number of detected events in that energy range
￼
weiji9:39 AM
I see, did you average them all with weight/livetime then? some dataset clearly has a higher stat than the other, do you take that into account?
￼
dkhaitan9:40 AM
when doing the final S1 spectrum for R4 we did weight by the live/deadtime
￼
weiji9:41 AM
why do you need to weigh it by deadtime?
￼
dkhaitan9:42 AM
you dont need to
9:42 AM
you can correct for deadtime if you wanted to
9:42 AM
both methods should give the same answers
￼
weiji9:47 AM
what is the range for s2 spectrum?
￼
dkhaitan9:48 AM
10-1010 in steps of 1
9:49 AM
I think, gotta check the code
￼
weiji9:50 AM
do you have the summary histogram(rate vs s1 size [phd]) for this spreedsheet somewhere?
￼
dkhaitan9:52 AM
I dont think so
9:52 AM
i do
￼
weiji9:53 AM
is the counts in the spreadsheet, counts in livetime. so taht if I scale by livetime, I get the frequency of s1  in [1,101 ]phd range?
￼
dkhaitan9:54 AM
thats the idea

sorry the s2 range is is 1-10001 in steps of 10 (edited)
￼
weiji9:58 AM
" 20160623_IsolatedS1Rate_spectrum.jpg ￼" is what I think I want. I guess it is too much to ask whether you have the number of each point. what is the bump at 15 phe do you know?
￼
dkhaitan10:00 AM
No idea
10:01 AM
The numbers are the average from the spreadsheet
10:01 AM
I think tomasz discounted that peak from his fit spectrum because he thought it was misidentified single extracted electrons
￼
weiji10:04 AM
bu se is much longer than s1, do you believe the se could contaimanate you s1 spectrum? 
I will need some time to digest the level 1,2,3. shall we talk later this week. Are you active on slack in the rest of the week?
￼
dkhaitan10:06 AM
I dont know, i havent looked into it.
10:06 AM
Yeah ill be on slack let me know what questions you have
￼
weiji10:37 AM
I have an additional question, do you happen to have the numbers of the s1 s2 trigger efficiency curve?
￼
dkhaitan10:40 AM
No i do not
